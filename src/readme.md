# Welcome to How2Host

### What's this about?

If you're considering setting up your own VPS or are currently in the process of doing so, with the goal of gaining independence from large, centralized corporations, **this comprehensive collection of guides is here to assist you**. These guides will walk you through every step, starting from the initial setup and leading all the way to configuring apps. This way, you won't have to read through countless different documentations and still figure out half of the work yourself!

### Where do I start?

🚀 **First Steps:** Embark on your hosting journey with confidence! We'll guide you through acquiring a server, getting your domain name, and building a solid foundation for what's to come.

🛡️ **Hardening:** Learn how to protect your server and services against online foes via different measures.

🔧 **Setup Apps:** Ready to dive into the app world? We'll walk you through setting up various apps, making the process as smooth as can be.

### I'm having trouble with something

That can only mean one thing - **the guides are still missing important information!** While there is currently no community for realtime assistance with these guides, it would help greatly if you [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/justrainer/how2host/issues/new) to let us know where you are struggling, so that we can rewrite the guides and make it easier to understand, or cover new edge cases.
